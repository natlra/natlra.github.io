            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
                Born in Paris, France, I quickly moved to the United States at the young age of 2. After three years, I moved back to Paris. After three more years, I returned to the US. After Three more years, I moved to London. After only one year, I moved to Boulder, Colorado and have been in the state ever since. Living between these two worlds, I was given an opportunity to understand how people change around our planet.

            <h2>Chef's Life</h2>
            <p>
                While living in Boulder I worked at multiple different restaurants, but one of these restaurants made a huge impact on my professional life. I worked as a Garm Chef at a restaurant called Pizzeria Locale, or now, Pizzeria Alberico. This was such a life changing experience because during my time there, I had the chance to be guided by chefs at Pizzeria Albericoâ€™s sister restaurant. These chefs changed the way I now see food, the way I see any tedious task, and the way I interact with coworkers. This sister restaurant, Frasca Food and Wine, is now the only place in Boulder to have earned a Michelin Star. Being able to work in this professional environment during my high school career was really what made me realize that through hard work, we can achieve great things.

        <h2>Precision Driving</h2>
        <p>
            I also have a deep love for cars and precision driving. I am currently working with a mechanic in Loveland to LS swap my track car. This car has been stripped and modified to compete in drifting competitions. I have spent many hours at the track practicing my driving skills in order to be able to compete during the summers. I am hoping that this is the year I finally get a sponsor so I can focus on driving and not have to worry about my car breaking all the time.
